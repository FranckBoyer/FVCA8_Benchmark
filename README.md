# Benchmark for the FVCA8 Conference

## Presentation

This benchmark aims at comparing the accuracy, robustness, complexity of modern finite volume methods on unstructured grids in the context of viscous incompressible flows computations (Stokes and/or Navier-Stokes equations).

It is proposed in the occasion of the [Eighth Conference on Finite Volumes for Complex Applications - FVCA8](https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/1299/) to be held in Lille (France) from June 12th to June 16th 2017.

## Definition of the benchmark

All the necessary informations on the proposed test cases and the expected outputs are given in the [PDF file](Benchmark.pdf)

The 2D and 3D meshes are available in the [Meshes folder](Meshes). The formats of the mesh files are described in the `README.md`.

## Contributions

The contributions to the benchmark will be published, after reviewing, in [Springer proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.springer.com/series/10533).
