##  The format of the 2D meshes

We provide two different formats for the meshes

 `*.typ1`  and  `*.typ2`

### Format .typ1

This file format is particularly designed for triangular or quadrangular control volumes. Each file contains the following informations:

*  the keyword `vertices`
*  the total number of vertices
*  the coordinates of the vertices
*  the keyword `triangles`
*  the total number of triangles (possibly 0)
*  for each triangle, a list of three integers representing its three vertices ordered clockwise
*  the keyword `quadrangles`
*  the total number of quadrangles (possibly 0)
*  for each quadrangle, a list of four integers representing its four vertices ordered clockwise
*  the keyword `edges of the boundary`
*  the total number of edges belonging to the boundary of the domain
*  for each boundary edge, a list of two integers representing its two vertices
*  the keyword `all edges`
*  the total number of edges ( intersection of two control volumes or of a control volume and the boundary of the domain)
*  for each edge, a list of four integers
   * the first two are the numbers of the two vertices of the edge
   * the last two are the numbers of the two control volumes (either triangle or quadrangle) defining the edge. By convention the fourth number is 0 if the edge lies on the boundary

### Format .typ2 

This format files is adapted to any kind of polygonal control volumes

*  the keyword `Vertices`
*  the total number of vertices
*  the coordinates of the vertices
*  the keyword `cells`
*  the total number of control volumes
*  for each control volume, a list of `N` integers :
   *  The first integer is the number of sides of the control volume. It should be equal to `N-1`
   *  The last `N-1` integers are the numbers of the vertices of the control volume ordered clockwise

### Example 

We consider a mesh of the unit square named `test` with 3 control volumes
      `[0,0.5]x[0,1]` , `[0.5,1]x[0,0.5]` , `[0.5,1]x[0.5,1]`
