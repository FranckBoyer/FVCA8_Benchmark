# Benchmark on finite volume schemes for incompressible flows 

## The three families of 3D meshes

### Hexahedra

### Tetrahedra

### Prisms with triangle bases

##  The format of the 3D meshes

We provide two formats for the meshes

 `*.msh` : GMSH ASCII format [see the WebSite of GMSH](http://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#MSH-ASCII-file-format) 
 
 `*.typ3`

### Format .typ3

Each file contains the following informations:

*  three lines of comments on the mesh (its description, its creator, ...)
*  the keyword `Version`
*  the version number
*  the keyword `Mesh name`
*  the name of the mesh
*  the keyword `Information on the mesh`
*  the keyword `Number of vertices`
*  the total number of vertices
*  the keyword `Number of control volume`
*  the total number of control volumes
*  the keyword `Number of faces`
*  the total number of faces
*  the keyword `Number of edges`
*  the total number of edges
*  the keyword `Vertices` *followed by* the number of total vertices
*  one line for each vertex that contains the three coordinates of the vertex
*  the keyword `Volumes->faces` *followed by* the number of total volumes
*  one line for each volume that contains a list of `N` integers:
   * The first one is the number of faces belonging to the current volume. It should be equal to `N-1`
   * The last `N-1` integers are the numbers of the faces for the current volume
*  the keyword `Volumes->Vertices` *followed by* the number of total volumes
*  one line for each volume that contains a list of `N` integers:
   * The first one is the number of vertices belonging to the current volume. It should be equal to `N-1`
   * The last `N-1` integers are the numbers of the vertices for the current volume
*  the keyword `Faces->Edges` *followed by* the number of total faces
*  one line for each face that contains a list of `N` integers:
   * The first one is the number of edges belonging to the current face. It should be equal to `N-1`
   * The last `N-1` integers are the numbers of the edges for the current face
*  the keyword `Faces->Vertices` *followed by* the number of total faces
*  one line for each face that contains a list of `N` integers:
   * The first one is the number of vertices belonging to the current face. It should be equal to `N-1`
   * The last `N-1` integers are the numbers of the vertices for the current face
*  the keyword `Faces->Control volumes` *followed by* the number of total faces
   * one line for each face containing the two numbers of the neighboring control volumes that share this face. The second number is conventionally set to `-1` for boundary faces.
*  the keyword `Edges` *followed by* the number of total edges
   * one line for each edge containing the two numbers of its two vertices
